# web-playground

A collection of small, interactive web projects built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, React.

## Projects

1. **Circle_intersection_Checker**
   Click anywhere on the screen to draw circle of random radius.
   It Checks if two circle intersect, touch, overlap or dont intersect.

2. **BLOB - File_Generation_And_Download**
   A BLOB (Binary Large Object) represents immutable binary data like files or images.
   A BLOB URL (URL.createObjectURL(blob)) creates a temporary link to access or download this data in web applications.

3. **Formik_and_Yup--( handles form state, validation, and submission easily )**
   ✅ Formik
   Formik is a popular React library that helps you build and manage forms easily. It handles:
   Form state
   Validation
   Submission
   Error messages
   It simplifies form code and reduces boilerplate in React apps.

   ✅ Yup
   Yup is a JavaScript schema validation library, often used with Formik to define:
   Validation rules (like required fields, min/max values, custom formats)
   Schemas that ensure data shape is correct
   Think of Yup as a tool to define “what your form data should look like.”

4. **Higher Order Components**
   A Higher Order Component is a function that takes a component and returns a new component with additional props, logic, or features.

5. **Custom hooks in react**
   A custom hook is a reusable function that encapsulates logic used in multiple components. It allows us to extract common functionality, making the code cleaner and more maintainable.
6. **useReducer**
   useReducer is a React Hook used for state management, especially when:
   ✏️ State logic is complex
   ✏️ Next state depends on the previous state
   ✏️ You want a Redux-like pattern (reducer + actions)
   ✏️ It’s an alternative to useState.

   const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);

   🟢 reducer: A function (state, action) => newState
   🟢 initialState: The starting state
   🟢 dispatch: A function to send actions to the reducer

7. **Using Multerfor file upload**
   Multer is a node.js middleware for handling multipart/form-data, which is primarily used for uploading files.
