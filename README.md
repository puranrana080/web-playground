Validation rules (like required fields, min/max values, custom formats)
Schemas that ensure data shape is correct
Think of Yup as a tool to define “what your form data should look like.”

4. **Higher Order Components**
   A Higher Order Component is a function that takes a component and returns a new component with additional props, logic, or features.

5. **Custom hooks in react**
   A custom hook is a reusable function that encapsulates logic used in multiple components. It allows us to extract common functionality, making the code cleaner and more maintainable.
